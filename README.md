# Erebus
Erebus is a simulation competition environment for a sub-league of [RoboCupJunior(RCJ) Rescue](https://junior.robocup.org/), that was first introduced as a demonstration in 2021. Since 2022, simulation (Erebus) has been an integral part of RCJ Rescue. The challenge is designed for semi-experienced to highly experienced programmers. The aim of the competition is to program a customizable robot to autonomously navigate and map a complex maze environment whilst detecting victims and avoiding obstacles.

Erebus is under constant development and will continue to serve as the basis for future RCJ Rescue international events. The competitions will be conducted under the [official rules](https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RCJRescueSimulation2025-final-1.pdf).
